OAI-PMH Gateway (plugin for Omeka)
==================================

[OAI-PMH Gateway] is a plugin for [Omeka] that exposes files and metadata of a
standard [OAI-PMH static repository] through Omeka used as a gateway.
[OAI-PMH static repository] is an implementation of the well-known standard
[OAI-PMH] of the [Open Archives] organization. So with this plugin, any OAI-PMH
harvester can harvest a static repository exposed by Omeka.

Such a static repository is a simple xml file that can be built with any editor.
The build process can be automated with the plugin [OAI-PMH Static Repository], that
transforms any local or remote directory of files and/or metadata files into a
standard static repository.

So, to try it quickly, install [OAI-PMH Repository], [OAI-PMH Harvester], [OAI-PMH Gateway],
and [OAI-PMH Static Repository] and follow the instructions in the [readme of OAI-PMH Static Repository].
You can use the included official example too.


Included official example
-------------------------

The example of static repository provided by [Open Archives] is included at
"tests/suite/_files/www.openarchives.org_StaticRepositoryExample.xml".

To try it, you need to:

- Install [OAI-PMH Repository] or the [improved fork] and this plugin.
- Copy and rename this file in a location that the server can access.
- Change with a simple text editor the base url inside the xml to indicate that
this static repository is exposed via the gateway provided by the plugin:
```xml
<oai:baseURL>http://gateway.institution.org/oai/an.oai.org/ma/mini.xml</oai:baseURL>
```
by something like this, using localhost or the domain, and the path to the file:
```xml
<oai:baseURL>http://localhost/MyOmeka/gateway/localhost/path/to/StaticRepositoryExample.xml</oai:baseURL>
```
- Click on "Check". If there is an error, check the base url and the access
rights of the server to the xml file, then reinitiate the gateway on this url by
resetting the status.
- Click on the provided url and the content of the static repository appears.
- If [OAI-PMH Harvester] is installed, click on "Harvest", and accept default
values. Two items will be created with metadata, and a collection for them.

The content of the static repository can be updated and the harvester will
update imported items automatically.

The "Public" switch allows to spread the static repository to the world, or to
keep it internally, for testing purpose of for local ingest.

The "Friend" switch allows to add it to the list of static repositories that
this gateway manages, even if records are not ingested by Omeka. The list is
viewable with the OAI-PMH verb "Identify". See [OAI-PMH Confederated Repositories] for more
details.


Installation
------------

Install first the plugin [OAI-PMH Repository].

Note: the official [OAI-PMH Repository] has been completed in an [improved fork],
in particular with a human interface, and until merge of the commits, the latter
is recommended.

You can install [OAI-PMH Harvester] too, specially if you use [OAI-PMH Static Repository]
to ingest files and/or metadata.

Note: the official [OAI-PMH Harvester] can only ingest standard metadata
(elements). If you want to ingest other standards, files and metadata of files,
extra data, and to manage records, you should use the fixed and improved [fork]
of it.

Then uncompress files and rename plugin folder `OaiPmhGateway`.

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.

Two parameters can be set in the file `config.ini` to manage harvestings.

To expose remote repositories and files via http/https, the server should have
access to them.


TODO
----

Some specifications related to the cache, the timeout, and the systematic check
of the original url are not fully implemented.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [plugin issues] page on GitHub.
