; list_limit = [integer]
; Number of individual records that can be returned in a response at once.
; Because a static repository is a prebuilt response for a small collection of
; records (< 5000), and because the process is streamed, the only reason to set
; a limit is the size of the network.
list_limit = 0

; token_expiration_time = [integer]
; In minutes, the length of time a resumption token is valid for.
; This means harvesters can re-try old partial list requests for this amount of
; time.  Larger values will make the tokens table grow somewhat larger.
token_expiration_time = 10
